# Randolio: Exporting

**ESX/QB supported**.

A script for all the grinders in your server that acts similar to boosting but without the tracker and cops. A tier/xp progression system built in starting from Tier 'D', leading up to 'S'. You have a limited time to deliver the vehicle to the export location which can be configured for each tier. The twist is that there is a BOMB attached to the vehicle and will auto detonate if you don't get it to the drop off in time or if you go too far from the vehicle.

Configurable payouts, thresholds, vehicles, xp gain and drop off locations for every tier. I'm not here to mind read the economy for your server, figure it out. Do not ask me for support or suggestions, just implement it yourself. Report any issues on github.

**Note**: Just because you are Tier 'B' for example, doesn't mean it's always gonna be a 'B' tier vehicle, it's chance based and you may get a vehicle that is one tier lower.
